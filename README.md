- 👋 Hi, I’m @NataliaChristofi

- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and to find insights from big datasets. This will enable companies to optimise their processes, save money and more. I like to be 
the "translator" between the more technical parts (data) and the business (managers/seniors).

- 🌱 I’m currently doing my Masters in Business Analytics at UCL learning how to efficiently analyse data with Python and R and visualise the results either with Python or Tableau. 
I am also learning how to link the findings with a company's business strategy whether this is in regards to marketing, business plan, finance, etc.

- 💞️ I’m looking to work on roles which involve data analysis and problem solving skills. I have 2+ years experience in the finance sector and more specific in Prime/Equity, 
Rates and FX asset classes. It was a very fast paced environment which required to be quick in making decisions and an analytical mind in order to solve/fix 
any issues either from internal or external traders and users.
