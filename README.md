- 👋 Hi, I’m @NataliaChristofi

- 👀 I’m **interested in Data Analytics**! Data is all around us and I find it interesting and exciting to **take data and transform it into a powerful strategic asset for a company**. This will enable companies to optimise their processes, save money, make thoughtful decisions and more. I like to be the "translator" between the more technical parts (data) and the business (managers/seniors).

- 🌱 I’m currently doing my **Masters in Business Analytics at UCL** learning how to efficiently analyse data with Python and R and visualise the results either with Python or Tableau. 
I am also learning how to link the findings with a company's business strategy whether this is in regards to marketing, business plan, finance, etc.

- 💞️ I’m looking to work on roles which involve data analysis and problem solving skills. I have 2+ years experience in the finance sector and more specific in Prime/Equity, Rates and FX asset classes. I have learnt to work in very fast paced environments as my previous role required an analytical mind in order to be quick in making decisions and solve/fix any issues either from internal or external traders and users.
